# SS2020_ML_Day2

Day 2 will provide an overview of Artificial Intelligence with a focus on Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). We will have hands-on tutorials on several popular DL problems such as Linear regression and classfication cases. Two major different DL frameworks - Tensorflow and PyTorch will be introduced to run on Compute Canada system via intereactive running mode with Jupyter notebook on login node. Furthermore, hands-on will be extended to run DL code using different hardware resources such as a single-GPU, multi-GPU and multi-GPU nodes using submitting jobs via scheduler.
